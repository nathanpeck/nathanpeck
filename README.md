### Hi I'm Nathan! ðŸ‘‹

- I work as a senior developer advocate at AWS ðŸ¥‘
- You can [chat with me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nathankpeck), or [check my blog](https://nathanpeck.com) for interesting articles and videos
- Here are some of my favorite open source sample applications I'm proud of:
  - A [serverless chat application](https://github.com/nathanpeck/socket.io-chat-fargate) built using AWS Fargate, and DynamoDB
  - A [serverless changelog crawler and search engine](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-changelogs-demo), which powers my website [changelogs.md](https://changelogs.md)
